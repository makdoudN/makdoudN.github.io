In the building of products, from what I see in my day to day work from individual contributors is two extremes:

1. The first is full owernship of the product, from the idea to the execution. 

2. The second is the segmentation of ownership, where each person is responsible for a small part of the product. 

I believe that the segmentation of ownership is a symptom of the merchant of complexity.

Through this post, I want to explore why I believe that full ownership should be the default for any product and why organizations falls for the segmentation of ownership.

Instinctively, separation of concerns is linked to specialization and arise from the need to divide work to increase productivity. 
This has been a thing in works through history, from the assembly line to the division of labor in factories.

But why does this instinct extend to product development ?

My objective is twofold:

1. To understand why full ownership is better than segmentation of ownership historically.
2. To understand how we can transition to full ownership in the modern age in software development.
