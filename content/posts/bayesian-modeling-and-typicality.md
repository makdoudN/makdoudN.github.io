# Bayesian Modeling and Typicality

In Bayesian modeling, typicality refers to how representative or "typical" an observation is under a given model. This concept is crucial for understanding model behavior and validating inference results.

## What is Typicality?

Typicality in Bayesian modeling relates to how well observations align with our model's expectations. An observation is considered "typical" if it falls within the range of values that our model predicts with high probability.
