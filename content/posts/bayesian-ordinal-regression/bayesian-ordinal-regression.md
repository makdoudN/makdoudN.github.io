**What is Ordinal Regression.**  Ordinal regression is a type of regression analysis used when the dependent variable is ordinal, meaning the categories have a natural order, but the intervals between them are not necessarily equal. 
The ordering may be subject to heterogeneity, meaning that different factors or groups may influence how the distances between categories vary, and this can be modeled explicitly using ordinal regression techniques.
The goal is to predict the ordinal outcomes while considering both the order and the unequal spacing between categories. 

For example, the temperature feeling is somewhat subjective and can be categorized as "cold", "cool", "neutral", "warm", "hot". 
Such a categorical variable is ordinal, we know that "cold" is colder than "cool", "cool" is colder than "neutral", etc.
Still, for one person, the difference between "cool" and "neutral" might not be the same as between "warm" and "hot".
Different people might have different perceptions of what is cold or hot.

This is where ordinal regression comes in.

**Why it is different from Classical Regression.** Classification treats all categories as independent and does not consider the natural order in ordinal data. For example, "poor" and "excellent" would be treated as equally different from "fair," which ignores the ordinal structure.

**Why is Ordinal Regression Important?**

1. **Preserving Ordinal Structure**. It respects the order of categories, unlike classification, which treats categories as unrelated. This leads to **more accurate models** for ordinal data by avoiding **incorrect assumptions about the relationships between outcomes**.
2. **Handling Unequal Intervals**. It acknowledges that the difference between adjacent categories may not be the same. This is crucial in many real-world situations (e.g., satisfaction scales), where these differences are not uniform. Or 
3. **Capturing Heterogeneity**. Ordinal regression allows for modeling heterogeneity between groups or categories. For instance, different population segments may perceive the distance between "good" and "excellent" differently, and this variability can be accounted for in the model.
4. **Better Interpretability**: Since the model respects the ordinal nature of the data, the results are more interpretable and meaningful when analyzing ordinal outcomes, compared to treating them as continuous or nominal categories.

How to derive from first principles a Bayesian Ordinal Regression?

### A detour with Binary Classification

Let's start by assuming we want to predict the binary variable $y$ from a number $N$ features $X \in \mathbb{R}^N$. 
A common approach in statistic is to use an inverse link function $f$ to (un)surprinsingly links the feature $X$ to the $y$. 
To be more precise, we will assume some probabilistic structure attached to the binary variable $y$ by letting $y \sim \operatorname{Ber}(y \mid p)$ and the inverse link function links the feature to the mean of the function $\mathbb{E}(y)=p=f(X ; p)$.

In the case of a linear binary logistic regression, 

$$ 
\mathbb{E}(y)= p =\frac{1}{1+\exp (-\eta)} \quad \text{with} \quad \eta = \sum X_i \omega_i + b
$$

**Why this form?**
We know that $p \in [0,1]$ so we need a function that outputs a value in this range.
The logistic function is a sigmoid function, that is, it is strictly increasing with values in $(0,1)$.
So basically, our program will infer $\omega$ that fits the data.
We can then leverage data to infer $p$ using MLE, MAP, bayesian inference or any approach that fits you.

As an example: here a code to infer the parameters using MLE approaches: 
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# YOUR DATA GOES HERE
# X = ...      (shape: [n_samples, n_features])
# y = ...      (shape: [n_samples,], integer from 0 to K-1)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))


def nll(X, y, theta):
    """
    Compute the negative log-likelihood for logistic regression.

    Parameters:
    X : ndarray
        Feature matrix where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.
    y : ndarray
        Target vector where each element is the target value for the corresponding sample.
    theta : ndarray
        Parameter vector for logistic regression.

    Returns:
    float
        The negative log-likelihood value.
    """
    predictions = sigmoid(X @ theta)
    # Ensure numerical stability by clipping predictions
    predictions = np.clip(predictions, 1e-15, 1 - 1e-15)
    
    log_likelihood = y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions)
    return -np.sum(log_likelihood)

# Initialization 
theta_init = np.ones(X_noisy.shape[1])

# Use scipy's minimize function to find the MLE estimate
result = minimize(
    lambda theta, X, y: nll(X, y, theta),
    theta_init,
    args=(X_noisy, y),
    method='BFGS'
)

print("Optimization Result:")
print("Success:", result.success)
print("Message:", result.message)
print("Estimated Parameters:", result.x)
print("Function Value (Negative Log-Likelihood):", result.fun)
```

Here, we have derive one model for binary classification. 
In the next section, we will propose an alternative model for binary classification that is more suitable for ordinal data.
In practice, this model is never used for binary classification but is will be a simple use-case to understand the modeling process of ordinal regression.

### Bayesian Binary Classification with a twist


**Data Generative Process â€”** 
We assume that there is a latent continuous variable which censored yield to the ordinal probabilities. Features  influenced the latent variable and as a result influences the final ordinal probabilities.

In contrast to previous approach, we introduce a latent variable $z$ and also a cutpoint $\alpha$ to model the ordinal probabilities.

0. **Prior Distribution.** 
We start by defining the prior distribution of the unknown parameters.
It reflects our beliefs about the likely values of the parameters before we have seen any data.
$$\boldsymbol{\beta} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0}, \tau^2 \mathbf{I}\right)$$
$$\alpha \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_\alpha, \sigma_\alpha^2\right)$$
$$\sigma^2 \sim \operatorname{Inverse-Gamma}\left(\alpha_\sigma, \beta_\sigma\right)$$


1. **Latent Variable Model** $z$. The latent variable is the result of a linear combination of the features and the parameters.
The model will infer the parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\alpha$ from the data. 
We hope that the model will be able to identify the latent variable $z$ that will allow us to predict the ordinal outcome $y$.
Intuitively, for the example of the temperature, for a person, the latent variable $z$ will represent a continuous affinity from the coldest to the hottest temperature.
$$
z_i =\mathbf{x}_i^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}
$$


2. **Threshold Mechanism**.
The observed ordinal outcome $y_i$ is determined by where $z_i$ falls relative to the cutpoints $\alpha_k$ :

$$
y_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } z_i \leq \alpha_1 \\
2 & \text{if } \alpha_1 < z_i \leq \alpha_2 \\
\vdots & \\
k & \text{if } \alpha_{k-1} < z_i \leq \alpha_k \\
\vdots & \\
K & \text{if } z_i > \alpha_{K-1}
\end{cases}
$$

A graphical representation of the data generative process is the following:

![img](/posts/bayesian-ordinal-regression/generative-process.png)


**What is the probability of a given ordinal outcome $P\left(y_i \mid \mathbf{x}_i\right)$?**

Given the threshold mechanism, the probability of a given ordinal outcome $P\left(y_i \mid \mathbf{x}_i\right)$ is the probability that the latent variable $z_i$ falls within the interval defined by the threshold $\alpha_{k-1}$ and $\alpha_k$.

$$ P(y=k | \mathbf{x})= P(\alpha_{k-1} < z \leq \alpha_k \mid \mathbf{x})= \Phi\left(\frac{\alpha_k-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma}\right)-\Phi\left(\frac{\alpha_{k-1}-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma}\right)$$


{{< details  title="Full Derivation" >}} 

Since $z \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2\right)$, we standardize $z$ to the standard normal distribution $(\mathcal{N}(0,1))$ using the transformation:

$$
z^{\prime}=\frac{z-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma} \quad \text { so that } z^{\prime} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

Rewriting the thresholds in terms of $z^{\prime}$ :

$$
P(y=k \mid \mathbf{x})= P\left(\frac{\alpha_{k-1}-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma} < z' \leq \frac{\alpha_k-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma}\right)
$$

For $z^{\prime} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $z^{\prime}$, denoted as $\Phi(\cdot)$, gives:

$$
P(y=k \mid \mathbf{x})=\Phi\left(\frac{\alpha_k-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma}\right)-\Phi\left(\frac{\alpha_{k-1}-\mathbf{x}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma}\right)
$$

You may be wondering if there is no identification problem here. 
By indentification problem, we mean that the model may not be able to distinguish between different parameters.
This is a problem because we want to infer the parameters from the data.

**Threshold and Latent Variable Shift**. The threshold and the latent variable may be shifted by the same constant without changing the ordinal outcome. 
$$
z_i \rightarrow z_i+c \quad \text { and } \quad \alpha_k \rightarrow \alpha_k+c,
$$
Those shift would lead $P\left(y_i \mid z_i, \alpha\right)$ unchanged. 
This creates a non-identifiability issue because $z_i$ and $\alpha_k$ are not uniquely determined.

**Shifting Thresholds by a Constant $c$ :** (TODO)
