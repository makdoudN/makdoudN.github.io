Tiny answer to this previous post [link](https://makdoudn.github.io/posts/the-challenge-of-focus/)

In summary, I thought that $ \textcolor{violet}{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\scriptsize 1}}} $ Action is hard and $ \textcolor{violet}{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\scriptsize 2}}} $ Repeated Actions in time toward a goal is harder.
I made the hypothesis that sharing incomplete work would lead to some a kind of inconfort.
And that the increasing inconfort would lead the action dedicated to finish the work.
Based on this observation, I decided to share incomplete posts. 

So based on the few months, I can share some preliminary thoughts about this strategy. 

- $ \textcolor{violet}{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\scriptsize 1}}} $ Sharing incomplete post does not increase my inconfort. 

The may largely be due that I believe that no one read this blog. 
To be honest, this is not an issue but without inconfort there is nothing to test and ultimately there is no change compared to not showing my incomplete works.

- $ \textcolor{violet}{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\scriptsize 2}}} $ I increase the number of incomplete posts.

I made some incomplete work on stuff that I read and liked. 
Still, I must say that those post are not finished. 
In a funny way, the post that I care the less [link](TIL-Full-Outer-Join) is finished and has been easily finished.

- $ \textcolor{violet}{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\scriptsize 3}}} $ I struggle to finish them. 

On a less positive note, I still struggle to finish those posts.
