**The Challenge of Focus —** I often find myself struggling to focus on a single task. 
It’s as though my mind is constantly shifting gears, moving from one task to another without fully committing to finishing anything. 
I start one thing, then quickly get distracted by something else—another idea, a side project, or just something more interesting in the moment. 
This cycle repeats throughout the day, or even the week, and by the end of the month, I’m left wondering: what did I actually accomplish?
The scattered progress across different tasks feels like running in circles, and without a clear way to track what’s been done, the achievements fade into the background of unfinished work.


**The Power of Public Accountability —** However, I’ve noticed something interesting. If my work-in-progress was made public, even if just a small number of people visited and followed my progress, it could be enough to shift my motivation. 
There's something about the act of showing your half-done work to others—no matter how few—that can drive you to push forward. 
Public accountability introduces a subtle but powerful force: the fear of embarrassment or shame over not completing something. 
This external pressure could, paradoxically, become a source of positive energy, transforming potential shame into a flow of small rewards. The thought of someone seeing my incomplete work would create a gentle push to finish it, turning what feels like a negative into a force for productivity.

**The Role of (Self) Shame in Motivation —** It’s interesting how (self) shame can be reframed as a growing "resource"—something that, when directed properly, can drive motivation and fuel the urge to complete tasks. 
While shame is often viewed negatively, in this case, it serves as a tool for progress. 
It acts like a subtle, internal nudge, reminding me of my unfinished work and pushing me to take action. 
Of course, external shame when it comes from others can be harmful and detrimental to one's mental well-being. 
But in my context, we are talking about a redirection of this natural resource within myself, converting it into something useful for a greater good.

By channeling that internal discomfort of having incomplete work into a public space, I can use it as a productive force. 
It’s a personal mechanism, a way of transforming the negative energy of guilt or shame into a kind of positive pressure. 
The end goal isn’t just to avoid embarrassment but to leverage it as a means to finish what I start.

**External Validation: A Necessity or a Tool? —**  Does this mean that external validation is necessary to complete my work? 
Ideally, the answer would be no. 
In a perfect world, my internal drive and self-discipline should be enough to carry me through to completion. 
But in reality, at least for me, it seems that the act of having even a small external audience plays a critical role. 
Knowing that someone might see what I’m doing—even in its imperfect, incomplete state—adds an extra layer of motivation. 
This doesn’t mean I rely solely on validation from others to get things done, but it does seem to create an important feedback loop for me.

So be it. 
If external validation helps, then I’ll embrace it. 
My plan is to open new entries on this blog and share my shameful work-in-progress. 
I'll see what happens when that (self) shame is on display, out in the open, where it can act as both a motivator and a tool for accountability. 
By making my unfinished work public, I hope to find a new rhythm of progress and discover if this mechanism can truly help me finish what I start.
